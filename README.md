## 1) What We Collect

### Account & Profile Data
- Email, username, profile name, optional profile photo.  
- Authentication details (hashed passwords or OAuth identifiers).

### AI Interactions
- Prompts, uploaded files (images, audio, documents), and any content you provide to the AI.  
- Model-generated outputs (chat history, saved responses).  
- Safety-related metadata (prompt classifications, abuse signals).

> Prompts and outputs are encrypted in transit and at rest.

### Model Improvement Signals (opt-in)
- Feedback (ratings, corrections, edits).  
- Participation in model-improvement programs only if you opt in.

### Image/Media Handling
- Non-reversible perceptual hashes (image fingerprints) for:
  - Spam prevention  
  - Duplicate upload detection  
  - Safety checks  
- We store only the fingerprint unless you store the original file in your workspace.

### Device & Usage Analytics
- Device type, OS, app version, diagnostics, crash logs, feature usage counts.  
- We do **not** perform cross-app tracking or advertising profiling.

### Cookies & Local Storage (web)

## 2) Why We Process Data — Lawful Bases

Under the DPDP Act, we rely on:

- **Consent** for optional analytics, model-improvement participation, access to photos/audio/files, notifications, and contacts discovery.  
- **Legitimate Uses** to operate and secure Kitab AI, provide AI responses and personalization (where allowed), detect misuse, ensure reliability, and comply with law.

You can withdraw consent anytime via Settings or by contacting us; withdrawal does not affect prior processing.
